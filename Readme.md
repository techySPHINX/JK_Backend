# Starting of Backend Journey with advanced version.

## Backend Essentials:

 Databases : Relational (SQL) or NoSQL databases store and manage your application's data.
 APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) : These act as intermediaries allowing your frontend (user interface) to communicate with the backend 
 and access data.
 Servers : These computers run your backend code and handle requests from the frontend.
 Server-side Logic #: The code that processes data, interacts with databases, and defines application behavior runs on the server. (e.g., Node.js, 
 Python)
 Security #: Implementing security measures like authentication and authorization is crucial to protect user data and application integrity.

## Industry-Standard File Structure:

While specific structures may vary, here's a general layout for a well-organized backend project:

config: Configuration files for environment variables, database connections, etc.
models: Files defining data models representing your application's data structure. (e.g., User model, Product model)
routes: Files handling incoming API requests and routing them to the appropriate functions.
controllers: Files containing logic to handle specific functionalities like user registration or data retrieval.
middleware: Reusable code modules that perform tasks like logging or authentication before requests reach controllers.
utils: Helper functions used across different parts of your backend codebase.
tests: Test files to ensure your backend code functions as expected. (Highly recommended for maintainability!)
